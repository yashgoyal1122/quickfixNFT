**AnswerNFTs**
A simple app that allows users to mint questions, puzzles, and riddles in form of NFTs and sells it.

For further understanding of the Project Idea, please look at "whitepaper.txt".

**Dev work:**

I've updated the NFT FA2 contract which I referenced from here(https://github.com/claudebarde/taquito-pinata-tezos-nft/blob/main/contract/NFTS_contract.mligo) to change the mint function to accept the answer(string) as input and then store it with the IPFS hash.
Then I created an entrypoint to retrieve this answer_hash stored from another contract(GetAnswerHash).
I have not added the functionality of putting the NFT for sale as it is already implemented and focused more on the unique functionality I am offering with my project.
You can look at the functionality of letting users buy NFT only if they provide the correct answer inside token_shop_contract.mligo
I joined the Hackathon late and before working on my project, I have to first learn Tezos development and then work on it. I haven't still understood the frontend development and deployment process(I figured out that you have to provide initial storage but I was struggling with it) so I haven't deployed my project to testnet/mainnet and neither built the frontend.


**My Journey:**

I was excited about this hackathon and have seen a previous hackathon organized by the tezos community but wasn't able to participate in it due to a lack of Tezos smart-contract development knowledge. As soon as I got to know about this hackathon I started learning about tezos smart contracts and LIGO. I learned LIGO from "tacode.dev" which is a very helpful and comprehensive resource. Also, I got loads of help from the discord community made for this Hackathon. Even if I do not win this hackathon, I would be grateful to the whole Tezos community for this immensely great experience of development on Tezos Blockchain. The ecosystem of development is very helpful and engaging. I am in college first year and this hackathon would greatly help me advance my experience in the Web3 and the Blockchain Development field.
